# Requirements

## Product Vision
Market-Message-Generator helps marketers turn a single campaign brief into platform-ready social posts. The project bundles a lightweight Node API with a React (Vite) client so you can generate, edit, and export drafts for Instagram, Facebook, and X.

### User Story
As a marketer, I want to generate platform-specific post drafts from a campaign brief so that I can publish consistent content faster.

### Motivation
Speed up content creation while preserving brand voice across platforms.

### Acceptance
- Accept a campaign brief and target platforms (Instagram, Facebook, X).
- Produce per-platform copy with length, hashtags, and handle formatting.
- Provide 3 tone presets (e.g., friendly, professional, witty).
- Indicate platform-specific constraints (e.g., X character limits) and fit.
- Persist generated drafts in a session for later editing.

### NFR
- Draft generation ≤ 3s for 1–3 platforms.
- Transparent privacy policy: no drafts logged beyond session unless saved.

### Outcome Measures
- Time-to-first-draft median ≤ 60s; ≥ 80% drafts within platform limits.

### User Story
As a marketer, I want to tweak generated drafts (tone, hashtags, mentions) per platform so that the posts match campaign goals.

### Motivation
Human-in-the-loop editing improves quality and adoption.

### Acceptance
- Inline editor per platform with live character counts and warnings.
- Tone slider updates copy suggestions without losing manual edits.
- Hashtag and mention helpers with de-duplication.
- Copy-to-clipboard per platform and export all as JSON.
- Autosave edits in local storage.

### NFR
- Editor interactions respond within 100ms.

### Outcome Measures
- ≥ 50% of drafts edited; ≤ 5% validation errors at publish.
