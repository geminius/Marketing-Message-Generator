## Task
- TASK-005 - Service.Generator - Tone re-suggestions without losing edits

## Checklist
- ✅ Scope: generator/handler updated to honor per-platform tone overrides and diff hints; storage boundaries unchanged.
- ✅ Tests: unit suite extended for tone variants/invalid tones (`tests/unit/api.test.js`).
- ✅ Tester evidence: PASS with 100.0% coverage in `.codex/runs/20250918T160200Z/tester.result.json`.
- ✅ Scripts (`./scripts/test|lint|build`) rerun and green.
- ✅ Changelog entry captured via builder log and task metadata.

## Notes
- `diffHint` heuristics are simple but adequate for current acceptance; revisit if UI needs finer granularity.
