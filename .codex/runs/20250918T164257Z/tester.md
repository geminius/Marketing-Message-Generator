## Task
- TASK-006 - Web.UI - Helpers, copy/export, autosave

## Actions
- Verified existing UI tests cover helper insertion, autosave, and import scenarios via `./scripts/test` (passes).
- Attempted coverage collection with `npx vitest run --coverage`; command fails because dependency `@vitest/coverage-v8` is not installed in the sandbox.

## Result
- BLOCKED: coverage_min=80 cannot be evaluated without the Vitest coverage plugin. Install `@vitest/coverage-v8` (or configure another supported provider) and rerun tests to generate coverage artifacts.

NEXT: address coverage dependency, then rerun Tester (04_tester.md) for TASK-006.
