## Task
- TASK-004 - Web.UI - DraftEditors with live counts

## Checklist
- ✅ Scope matches task summary; new draft editors live under `src/ui` with no policy violations.
- ✅ Tests cover limit warnings and edit persistence (`tests/ui/draft-editors.test.jsx`).
- ✅ Tester PASS recorded in `.codex/runs/20250918T150241Z/tester.result.json` with 100.0% coverage (>=80 requirement).
- ✅ Environment/UX flows consistent with brief form; lint/build/test rerun after changes.

## Notes
- Editors compute limits client-side using platform metadata and keep manual edits intact across regenerate calls. No further issues observed.
