- [x] Tests present and passing (`./scripts/test`, `CI=true npm run test -- --coverage`)
- [x] Coverage â‰¥ policy minimum (statements 92.53%, branches 64.96%, functions 93.33%, lines 92.53%)
- [x] Changelog / metadata updated
- [x] No dependency policy violations

## Notes
- UI counter now relies on `Array.from` to align with backend surrogate-aware counting, preventing false over-limit warnings for emoji-heavy drafts.
- Added regression test injecting multi-byte glyphs via `fireEvent.change`, guarding against future regressions.
